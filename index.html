    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>I'm a CS major. This is my Second Year in school. I've only taken two CS classes so far, But it's coming.</p>
    <p>I started coding in c++ when I was 14. I loved it, and I've since learned java, python, and as of 11:00 o clock this morning, HTML.</p>
    <p>Here's a picture of me with a pig</p>
